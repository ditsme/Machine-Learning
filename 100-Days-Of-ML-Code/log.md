# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log
I will keep on adding my everyday work in this repository
## Day 01- July 08, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Logistic Regression and it's applications.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with application in Python initially, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.I am well versed with virtual environments, Jupyter Notebook,basic Python libraries such as Numpy,Pandas, Matplotlib etc. I have also understood more about Logistic and Linear Regression in detail and understood the difference between both.

## Day 02- July 09, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Successfully implemented Support Vector Machines and different kernel models.

**Thoughts:** I feel more confident about SVMs after studying in detail about the SVM,it's implementation and all the different kernels used. I also realised the difference between Logistic Regression and SVMs.

## Day 03- July 10, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Pumpkin prices predicted using Polynomial Regression.

**Thoughts:** I am understanding more and more about Regression models and their types.

## Day 04- July 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Diving into Unsupervised Learning.

**Thoughts:** Learnt about k-means clustering implementing in fraud detection and also realized that  unsupervised learning gives a low accuracy then supervised learning .
